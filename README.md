# Freeflow

An OS X app to easily create flow charts.

![Freeflow Mockup](https://github.com/fnky/Freeflow/blob/master/Mockups/Mockup-001.png)

## Dependencies

- Xcode 6.0.x
- OS X 10.10 Yosemite (only tested)

## Development

This project is just for fun, learning Objective-C (perhaps later Swift) and to write a real-like OS X application. However, you can of course contribute as much as you'd like – I love getting to know better ways of doing things more effienct.

## About

You can read more about the project in the [wiki](//github.com/fnky/Freeflow/wiki).
